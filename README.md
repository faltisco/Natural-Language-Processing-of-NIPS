# Natural_Language_Processing_NeurIPS_Papers
The purpose this project is to do a topic based analysis of the content in papers submitted at an annual machine learning and computational neuroscience conference, NeurIPS.  (For more info on the conference, see : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_on_Neural_Information_Processing_Systems). The papers were presented at the NeurIPS between 1987 and 2017. Kaggle provides several CSV files of the papers in that corpus, there are more than 7,200 rows/samples of data, each represtng an individual paper. The papers were explored via NLP techniques (using sklearn) and Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) used to detect the topics within. After the analysis, findings, especially the trends of topics and how they changed over time are better understood and presented.
