# Natural-Language-Processing-of-NIPS
The purpose this project is to do a topic based analysis of the content in papers submitted at an annual machine learning and computational neuroscience conference, NIPS.  (For more info on the conference, see : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_on_Neural_Information_Processing_Systems). The subjects contained in over 50,000 papers presented at the NIPS between 1987 and 2017. Kaggle provides several csv files of the papers presented there. In the corpus, there are more than 7,200 papers. The papers were explored via NLP techniques (using sklearn) and the data was analyzed using visualizations, so trends of topics can be understood and presented.
