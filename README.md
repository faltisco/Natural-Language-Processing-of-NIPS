# Natural_Language_Processing_NIPS_Papers
The purpose this project is to do a topic based analysis of the content in papers submitted at an annual machine learning and computational neuroscience conference, NIPS.  (For more info on the conference, see : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conference_on_Neural_Information_Processing_Systems). The subjects contained in over 50,000 papers presented at the NIPS between 1987 and 2017. Kaggle provides several CSV files of the papers and in that corpus, there are more than 7,200 rows/samples of data. The papers were explored via NLP techniques (using sklearn) and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) used to detect the topics within. After the analysis, findings, especially topical trends of topics are better understood and presented.
